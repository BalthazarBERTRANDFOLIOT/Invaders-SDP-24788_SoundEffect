# Rain_Development

## Team Introduction

Our Rain Development team's goal is to design and implement a core level structure that provides players with constant fun and challenges. Beyond simply listing enemies, we want to build a flexible and scalable system that systematically manages enemy deployments, wave flows, and difficulty escalation curves. Our vision is to maximize the replay value of the game by allowing players to experience new and exciting challenges as they progress. The team's name has a neutral meaning. It literally means "non-development," or "develop as if you're not developing." We aim to build a flexible system that allows anyone to design and expand new levels as if they were doing creative activities, rather than developing. Our team's strengths are that they are very good at bug fixes and have experience making games. So, I can be confident that I can flexibly cope with the problems I want to solve as a middleman in collaboration between teams.

## Team Requirements

Our team is responsible for all planning and implementation related to the game's ‘levels’. The main requirements are as follows.

- **Build a Level Data Management System**: Develop a system that manages level configurations via external files (JSON, CSV, etc.), enabling easy addition or modification of levels without directly modifying game code.
- **Implement Wave Progression Logic**: Implement a ‘wave’ system where enemies appear sequentially or based on specific conditions within each level. Manage the flow where defeating all enemies in the current wave triggers the next wave.
- **Design Difficulty Adjustment System**: Design a structure where the game's difficulty progressively increases as the player advances through levels. This includes adjustments to enemy movement speed, attack frequency, and variations in enemy types and quantities.
- **Implementation of Diverse Level Patterns and Events**: Plan and implement events beyond simple enemy placement, such as special enemy waves unique to certain levels, mid-boss appearances, or special item drops.
